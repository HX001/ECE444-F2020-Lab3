## Activity 3: The difference between SQL or NoSQL database.
SQL | NoSQL
------------ | -------------
SQL databases are  Relational Databases (RDBMS) | NoSQL database are non-relational or distributed database
SQL databases are table based databases | NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores
SQL databases have predefined schema | NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data
SQL databases are vertically scalable | NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable
SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data | NoSQL Queries are focused on collection of documents. Also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language)
SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment | NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries
SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage | NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data
